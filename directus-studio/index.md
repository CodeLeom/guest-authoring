## Introduction

Building a user-friendly and useable product is important, but an effective customer feedback and support is pivotal for business success. [Directus](https://directus.io), an open-source flexible platform that offers solutions such as the Headless CMS, Backend-as-a-service more amazing features that can be tailored to various needs, including creating a dynamic support ticket form for your product. This article will guide you through using Directus Studio to build a support ticket form that allows customers to submit their queries or issues on your product offerings.

## Before You Start

**:cloud: Instance**
Imagine a scenario where your business receives numerous customer inquiries daily. Managing these inquiries efficiently becomes importantant. In this article, you will learn how [Directus](https://directus.io) can be helpful in building a seamless support ticket handling system for your business.
<!-- ## Your Sections Here -->


- Ensure that you have setup a Directus account either on the [Directus Cloud](https://directus.cloud/) or on your local development environment using [docker](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/quickstart.html). Watch this youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOCfBBTMtoE) for a step-by-step guide in setting up Directus locally on your computer.

- Log into your Directus account, you'll create a specific schema for your support ticket form. This schema will include the `Customer` and the `Support`control fields. The control fields allows you to assign the ticket to an available support agent including the summary of the ticket resolution. Below is the structure of the schema
	- Customer Fields: Name, Email, Issue Type (options like Billing, Technical Issue, General Inquiry), Description, and Submission Date.
	- Support Fields: Ticket ID (auto-increment), Status (Open, In Progress, Resolved), Assigned To (support agent), and Resolution Summary.

- Configuring roles for the support agents and the customers:
	-  `Customers` can create tickets and view the status of their own tickets.

	-  `Support Agents` has access to view assigned tickets, update statuses.

Setting up these roles and permissions ensures that customers have a straightforward way to submit and track their inquiries while giving support agents the tools needed to manage and resolve tickets efficiently.

## Designing the Agent Schema
The support agent schema is useful for managing a dedicated support team: below are the few fields to include in the `agent` schema:

1. Create a New Collection: Name it `agens`. This collection will be where all your agents will be added. Rename the `id` to `agent-id` which will be your primary key and change the type `uuid`.
2. Create a new field, `assigned` the field type will be `many-to-one`. The related collection will be `directus_users`. This will allow you to select your agents and add them to this collection.
3. Configure the access to this collection to be visible to only admin. Save your chnages.


## Designing the Support Ticket Schema

The major part of the support ticket system is its schema. In Directus Studio:

1. Create a New Collection: Name it `support_tickets`. This collection will store all customer queries. Creating a fresh collection, Directus suggest an initial field, `id` as the unique key of your collection. Rename the id field to `ticket-id` which will be your primary key and leave the type as auto-incremented integer.

```
:::hint

After giving your collection a name, the next page allow you to select some fields such as `status`, `created on`, `updated on`, and `updated by`.

:::
```

2. Define the Fields:
   - `customer_name` and `customer_email`: The data type is `text`. This allow you to identify the customer.
   - `issue_type` (dropdown): Define lists like 'Billing', 'Technical Issue', 'General Inquiry', etc.
   - `description` (Text Field): Detailed description of the issue.
   - `status` (Dropdown): Options like 'Open', 'In Progress', 'Resolved'.
   - `created_at` (Date Field): Automatically captures the ticket submission time.
   - `assigned_to` (ManyToOne, selecting the support agent collection): this is used by the admin to assign the ticket to a support agent. This means many tickets can be assigned to one support agent. This field will only be visible to the admin.

**:bulb: Note**:
Make sure to check the "required" option for critical fields like customer_email and issue_type to prevent incomplete submissions.

Ensure each field is correctly set up for its purpose, especially concerning data types, placeholder where necessary, and default values.


## Implementing the communication flow
This section highlight the communication flow of your support ticket system between customers and support agents:

**For Customers:**
- Customers submit tickets through a Directus form, detailing their issue or inquiry.
- They can view the status of their submitted tickets and receive notifications for any updates or messages.
- Access to a direct communication interface with the support agent handling their case.

**For Support Agents:**
- Agents can view incoming tickets, filter them by status or issue type, and assign them to themselves or others.
- They update ticket statuses (e.g., from Open to In Progress to Resolved) and communicate directly with customers through the ticket's messaging system.
- Agents add a resolution summary once the issue is resolved, which can be viewed by the customer.

## Configuring Roles and Permissions

Directusâ€™s flexibility in permissions allows you to control access precisely:
![Roles and permissions tab on Directus studio](access-control.png)

1. **Navigate to Roles & Permissions** in Directus Studio and create two new roles named `Customer`, `Agent`. Agents will be assigned to review and treat tickets.
2. **Set Permissions for the `Customer` Role:** Allow `read` and `create` access to the `support_tickets` collection. It's crucial to restrict `read` access to only their tickets, ensuring privacy and security.

3. **Set Permissions for the `Agent` Role:** Allow `read` and `update` access to the `support_tickets` assigned to them.

```
:::Rule Setting

Directus allows you to apply filters to permissions. To ensure users can only see their own tickets, you'll apply a filter on the Read permission. According to the image above, you'll allow the user to see only the tickets they created. You need to choose the field that links the ticket to the user. This is often a user ID or user email field in the ticket collection that references the user who submitted the ticket. This same goes to the permission set on the Agent role as well. You can read more about user fileds on the [documentation](https://docs.directus.io/reference/system/users.html).

Test this setting with a test account before going live.

## Inviting Customers to Use the Form

To allow customers to submit tickets, you must add them to Directus and assign them the `Customer`/`User` role based on what the configuration is:

1. Add Users in Directus Studio: Go to the Users section and invite customers via email.
   ![Invite user to your directus platform](user-directory.png)
2. **Assign Roles:** Ensure each customer user is assigned the `Customer` role to access and submit the support ticket form.

## Basic System Walkthrough

### Customer
1. The customer logs into the Directus platform and navigates to the support ticket form.
2. They fill out the form with their details and issue description and submit the ticket.
3. The customer can then go to their ticket overview page to see the status of their ticket and any messages from support agents.

### Support Agents
1. The support agent views a dashboard of all tickets, filtered by their current status.
2. Upon selecting a ticket, the agent can see all details provided by the customer and start a conversation through the messaging system within the ticket.
3. As they work on resolving the ticket, the agent updates the ticket's status and, once resolved, adds a resolution summary for the customer to view.

## Best Practices
An effective support ticket system is an evolving tool. Regular reviews of customer feedback and ticket resolution times can highlight areas for improvement. Adjusting the ticket schema, roles, and communication flow based on this analysis ensures that the system remains efficient and responsive to customer needs.
